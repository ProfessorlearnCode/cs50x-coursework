1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
        SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs LIMIT 100;


2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
        Considering only the top 100 entries may not be the most accurate way to predict the aura as we need to also consider 'lost preferences', 'seasonal trends' and
        change of mood of the person as a whole (maybe the person have matured or puberty?) etc. We have to consider using other techinques and algorithms to also tend to those
        factors which may help us to create a much more connected (person) result for 'aura'.
